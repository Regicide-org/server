#A note on editing this file.
#----------------------------
#Do not alter this file if it is in the reference folder.
#Before you edit this file, read about how Towny handles
#language files:
#https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works#multi-language.
#A note on text formatting (how Towny status_title_pvpinserts words.)
#----------------------------------------------------
#You MUST retain spacing in the texts.
#If a text begins or ends with a space, it must remain that
#way.
#%s = data to be supplied by the plugin.
#If you find that a line has multiple %s variables which would
#be in a different order in your language, you can change them
#to %1$s, %2$s, %4$s, %3$s to change their order. ie: %4$s
#will always use the 4th variable, no matter where it is
#placed on the line.
#A note on text colouring and formatting.
#----------------------------------------
